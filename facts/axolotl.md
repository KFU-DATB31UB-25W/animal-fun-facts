# Axolotl

- The axolotl is an aquatic salamander from the lakes near Mexico City.
- It never "grows up": it keeps its feathery gills as an adult. This
  forever young state is called neoteny.
- Axolotls can regrow lost body parts, like legs and parts of their
  spine or heart.
- In the wild they are critically endangered because their habitat in
  Xochimilco is polluted and shrinking.
