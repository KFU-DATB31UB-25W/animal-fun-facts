# Octopus Fun Facts

## Intelligence
Octopuses are highly intelligent invertebrates. They can solve complex
puzzles, use tools, and even learn by watching other octopuses perform
tasks.

## Three Hearts
Octopuses have three hearts: two pump blood to the gills, while the
third pumps blood to the rest of the body. When an octopus swims, the
heart that delivers blood to the body stops beating, which is why they
prefer crawling to swimming.

## Blue Blood
Their blood is blue due to a copper-based protein called hemocyanin,
which is more efficient at transporting oxygen in cold, low-oxygen
environments than the iron-based hemoglobin found in mammals.

## Boneless Body
Octopuses have no bones whatsoever, allowing them to squeeze through
any opening larger than their hard beak, which is their only rigid body
part.

## Master of Disguise
They can change both the color and texture of their skin in less than
a second to blend in with their surroundings, using specialized cells
called chromatophores, iridophores, and leucophores.

## Defense Mechanisms
When threatened, octopuses can release a cloud of ink containing
compounds that dull a predator's sense of smell. They can also detach
an arm that continues to wiggle independently, distracting predators.

## Short Lifespan
Most octopus species live only 1-2 years. Female octopuses often die
shortly after their eggs hatch, as they stop eating entirely while
guarding their eggs for months.

## Nine Brains
An octopus has one central brain and eight smaller brains, one in each
arm. This allows each arm to act independently, tasting and touching
without waiting for signals from the central brain.
