- Elephant seals can dive for up to 1.5 hours and
  their depth record is at 2,388m which is deeper than
  a nuclear submarine.

- Their fur pattern is individual like a fingerprint.

- Weddell seals can give birth to twins.
  
- Male elephant seals will go 3 months without eating
  just to assert dominance over other males.

- Seals can lower their heart rate to 4 beats per minute.

- Most seal moms don't eat during the nursing period
  and rely on their blubber instead.

- Seal milk is the most fatty milk of any animal
  with over 80% fat content. They use it to tranfer around
